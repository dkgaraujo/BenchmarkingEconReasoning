    "Language models (LMs), in particular those classified as generative artificial intelligence (gen AI), are finding increasing uses in finance and economics. These models are usually tested for their ability to reason, and seem to do well: for example, OpenAI's GPT-4 boats more than 80% correct results in academic and professional micro- and macroeconomics tests (@achiam2023gpt). Still, even such advanced models can fail miserably. @perez2024testing demonstrate how the same model can correctly solve a logical puzzle requiring reasoning about higher order knowledge, only to fail when irrelevant details are changed. Building on results such as this and other examples that clearly illustrate the limits of rationality assumptions on LMs, this work discusses how to systematically measure *economic* reasoning, combining literatures on economic thought and on computer science about gen AI benchmarking. In practical terms, the task at hand is to come up with testing mechanisms that estimate the level of economic reasoning of an LM by means of a prompt consisting of $n \\geq 0$ examples and a question with multiple answers."

    "Similar to many other social disciplines, economics requires the analytical judgment referred to by @robbins1932essay in the analyses of events as a basis to extrapolate and predict, and this has a bearing on how economic reasoning should be benchmarked. Economic inference depends primarily on articulating unobservable quantities, theorecised and estimated on the basis of observable measures. This is unlike other major disciplines. For example, in human and veterinary medicine, all physiological and pathological variables of clinical importance are observable, even if that is not yet technologically feasible today. In the medical sciences, theoretical models merely fill in the gaps in the absence of a technologically feasible complete measurement. In contrast, many economically relevant quantities are latent variables that cannot by definition be observed, and always require a model applied to data to be estimated, implicit or not."

    "A quantitative test for economic reasoning must take this into account: selecting a correct answer in an economics question through reasoning will always depend on an unobserved transformation of the information received and the existing knowledge. This is important. LMs may also happen to choose the correct answer from either luck of through simple token probability. It is easy to see why a correct answer selected by chance is not informative about the reasoning abilities of a model. The second case requires more explanation: mathematically, LMs are trained to identify the most likely token $\\theta$ in a vocabulary $V$ given the tokens in its prompt. In practice, the function is inexcrutable so it is also considered an unobservable transformation. But a few characteristics allows us to distinguish reasoning from prediction. First, reasoning is robust to minutiae and other irrelevant detail. Mathematically, it would be analogous to applying a manifold transformation that retains only the relevant information in a prompt and then applies logic operations on top of them, and on them only. Second, reasoning is locally complete, meaning that an LM that can correctly deduce that A implies B also is able to understand that A' does not imply B, or that A does not imply B'. In other words, a reasoning that appears to be correct but whose obvious corolary is not achieved by an LM cannot be said to have been reasoned in the first place."

In any case, @parkes2015economic see economic reasoning as the ability to understand and solve complex game-theoretical environments (eg, the poker example). @mei2024turing do an extensive comparison of personality traits from the behaviour of ChatGPT with human behaviour in games that require cooperation, finding that its performance is consistent with humans, and when it deviates the AI models tend to behave in the altruistic and cooperative than the mass distribution of humans. Interestingly, ChatGPT responds differently to different formulations of the same situation. In contrast to @mei2024turing, this paper and its empirical counterpart are more generall, and discuss reasoning as a whole. Another contrast to that paper is that the current benchmark is focused on reasoning ability only, not personality. @perez2024testing illustrate the brittleness of a leading AI's reasoning, which has markedly lower performance when trivial details in the prompts are different. Similarly, @korinek2023gen report (in his Chat 23) that results from a technical prompt in economics are reasonable but also brittle, with answers changing when prompt wording changes or even simply if the tasks are re-ordered."

However, this measures only the model's ability to answer correctly, *not necessarily* its reasoning capabilities. The latter are part of a latent state space sitting between the input prompt and the answer. More concretely, for an input prompt $X$, which includes a question and any necessary explicit information, the language model is a function $\\mathbf{M}$ that maps it to a given response: $\\mathbf{M} : X \\to y$. In order to show that it is done by reasoning, we need tests (and more specifically, measurements) that convey some information about the inner workings of this function. \n",

Using as an approachable example the simplest possible neural network, the logistic regression $\\mathbf{N}(x) = \\sigma(Wx + b)$, such robustness further implies that $\\frac{d\\mathbf{N}}{d x} = \\sigma(Wx + b)(1-\\sigma(Wx + b))W = 0$. Because $W$ cannot be a zero vector in a functioning network that is responsive to its inputs and $\\sigma(Wx + b)(1-\\sigma(Wx + b)) = 0$ has no solution because neither term is 0 or 1 in a sigmoid function with finite inputs, the neural network cannot be a constant function.

For example, take the following quote from the character Barf in the 1987 movie Spaceballs, organised as two sentences \"I'm a mog. Half man, half dog.\" and \"I'm my own best friend.\" With word-level tokenisation, $\\mathbf{S} = \\{(\"\\text{I'm}\", 1), (\"\\text{a}\", 2), (\"\\text{mog}\", 3), (\"\\text{.}\", 4), (\"\\text{Half}\", 5), (\"\\text{man}\", 6), (\"\\text{,}\", 7), (\"\\text{half}\", 8), (\"\\text{dog}\", 9), (\"\\text{.}\", 10)\\}$ and $\\mathbf{C}$ is similarly broken down. This example illustrates that even when there is not a logical connection grounded in truth, tokens in one sentence - even those made up like \"mog\", can have a bearing on the likelihood of tokens appearing in another sentence. This likelihood can differ depending on the location of the token, which also allows for situations where repeteating of a word $\\tau$ is meant to convey different meaning. Another feature of this example is that all $\\pi_{\\text{Barf}, C}(\\theta) = 1 \\forall \\theta \\in \\mathbf{S}$. In the alternative sentence \"I'm a mog. Half man, half dog.

The exact underpinnings of these logical rules are beyond the scope of this work - it can be approximated by a possibly non-linear function, $g$. What suffices in this work is to say that reasoning *depends* on correctly classifying the tokens: all relevant tokens must be so identified, lest they be either ignored as the irrelevant ones or taken with the opposite meaning. Similarly, if all relevant tokens are indeed diagnosed correctly but other tokens are also diagnosed as relevant when they are not, then this will cause problems for the correct reasoning. In other words, a first precondition for reasoning is to have a low categorical cross-entropy loss. Intuitively, a pre-condition of reasoning is to correctly interpret the inputs."

    "Let me conclude with Ken Arrow's impossibility theorem (CITE), or rather the story of how he achieved this incredibly influential result. Arrow first attempted to improve upon two-century-old Condorcet's paradox, and studied ways in which individual preferences could be aggregated while satisfying some intuitive conditions. It was only through repeated failures to do so that he switched the focus to attempting to prove its impossibility. While Arrow can be safely used as a prime example of economic reasoning, the point this anecdote illustrates is that breakthroughs in economic knowledge require also inspiration (in this case from the appeal of addressing Condorcet's paradox) as well as persistence and ability to change one's focus. The current work focuses on developing robust benchmarks of models' reasoning abilities in economics; further work exploring their contributions to inspiration[^ideation] and to methodological assistance (as in the example to change focus) are also warranted for a more complete assessment of models' abilities to provide cognitive support to human economists.\n",
