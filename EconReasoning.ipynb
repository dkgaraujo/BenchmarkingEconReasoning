    "abstract: \"A theory-informed model of economic reasoning combines information filtering, knowledge association and logic attribution to correctly answer prompts. The successful application of these steps defines a reasoned answer; all others are due to luck or probabilistic association. This paper describes how the model can inform the creation of a challenging and informative benchmark of reasoning ability in advanced artificial intelligence models. The reasoning model, along with insights from social economics, informs the design of an economic reasoning benchmark that (a) evolves over time in a non-trainable way; (b) measures reasoning rather than pure accuracy and (c) breaks down reasoning results into its constituent components. An accompanying training dataset will be publicly available at publication time, and interested users can submit task proposals. The benchmarking process is adapted for economics but can also be applied to other sciences. NB: Empirical estimations are being run.

    "Large language models (LLMs), in particular those classified as generative artificial intelligence (gen AI), increasingly support use cases in finance and economics (@korinek2023gen), including in central banks (@araujo2024artificial). These models are tested for their ability to reason, often boasting seemingly incredible results: for example, OpenAI's GPT-4 boats human-like performance across tests of reasoning and more than 80% correct results in academic and professional micro- and macroeconomics tests (@achiam2023gpt). Still, even such advanced models can fail miserably when it comes to reasoning: for example, an advanced model can correctly solve a logical puzzle requiring reasoning about higher order knowledge, only to fail when irrelevant details are changed (@perez2024testing). Building on results such as this, this work discusses how to systematically measure *economic* reasoning, combining literatures on economic thought and on computer science about gen AI benchmarking. In practical terms, the task at hand is to come up with a benchmark task for economic reasoning, a testing mechanism to measures in a comparable way the level of economic reasoning of an artificial intelligence (AI) model. This task is of first-order importance given the break-neck speed of evolution of LLMs (@yang2023harnessing) and their potential risks (@danielsson2022artificial)."

Results of benchmark tasks are now a staple of the evaluation of LLMs by developers when releasing a model, highlighting its evolution compared to previous versions and to the main peers. Third-party organisations also compile leaderboards with running results that allow the general public to keep track of the most performant models.[^leaderboards] Benchmark tasks are useful because that they provide a comparable metric on which to track the state-of-the-art for the particular abilities that each task measures. Usually, this metric is the percentage of correct answers. However, even if specific tasks have evolved over time to become more challenging, a key challenge is to separate correct answers due to probabilistic association or \"stochastic parroting\" (@bender2021dangers) from those that are the result of a reasoning process.\n",

    "This paper proposes a working model of reasoning that can underlie an empirical benchmark task: when confronted with a prompt $Q$,[^prompt] an AI is said to *reason* correctly if it responds with an answer $\\alpha$ that simultaneously (a) interprets the prompt, identifying the relevant information for the task and filtering away everything else by ignoring or abstract away irrelevant details, (b) associates $Q$ with any relevant existing commonsense knowledge $\\theta$ to answer the question, and (c) applies logical relations such as deduction and induction to $Q$ and $\\theta$ to arrive at the correct answer. Formally, each answer is defined as a non-parametric function of the following steps: information filtering $\\phi = f(Q)$, knowledge curation $\\kappa = k(\\phi, \\theta)$ and logic attribution $\\lambda = l(\\kappa, Q)$, $\\alpha = A(\\lambda, Q)$, where $A$ is the function that returns the correct answer from the prompt $Q$ given a successful implementation of the component steps. Each of those three steps above are sequential, and depend on the successful completion of the previous one. The goal is for this model to be simple and intuitive.

    "This model can be used as a general abstraction for an AI reasoning ability, but two practical adaptations in $Q$ can make it a model for economic reasoning more specifically. First, the scope of topics that are included in $Q$ should ideally focus on issues of significance to economics. At its most essential form, testing for economic reasoning is the same as probing if the model is able to think in terms of logical operators on information that is of relevance to economics. However, this is subjective because economic thought constantly evolves. At the same time, including only \"classical\" economics carries a high risk of using material that is containd in the training set of AI models. Second, even for each given topic, the types of questions considered relevant in economics are specific. Both of these issues are dealt with in practice by using recent published academic work as source material to construct seed questions.[^other] These sources contain content whose topic and research questions are by definition of interest to the economics field, and moreover have the advantage of being novel by design, creating a natural check for the ability of AI models to generalise reasoning.\n",

    "This benchmark task is, by design, more difficult than others due to its sequential conditioning. Is it really necessary to have such a hard-to-score task? While evidence amounts that large language models (LLMs) cannot perform advanced reasoning, at least not when fine-tuned or with access to external reference material or sophisticated math funcionalities, it is important to have a challenging reasoning benchmark because the latter two possibilities are increasingly being used. Both fine-tuning on specific data and plugging LLMs into sources of knowlege (as in retrieval-augmented generations, or RAGs) or with plugins as Wolfram Alpha or Mathematica might provide models with some reasoning ability. For this reason, it is important to have a robust way of measuring the reasoning abilities of AI models. Another argument is that part of AI models' reasoning performance out of the box is due to its limitation to train only on available written language only (@BrowningLeCun2022). Of course, this dataset is a very limited snapshot of human experience, even with massive data compilations. However, current and future models will be able to leverage a significant part of the other non-text data (eg, video, audio, pictures) and thus could reasonably attempt to achieve better reasoning.

    "Secondly, this paper draws from insighs in the more general AI reasoning literature. As other parts of AI development, it is informed and inspired by neuroscience as well (@HASSABIS2017245).

    "A nascent literature on the evaluation of language models in economic settings. An early foray into questions related to AI's ability to conduct economic reasoning is due to @parkes2015economic. But their angle is more on how AIs can be used to estimate synthetic economic agents - machina oeconomicus - ideal versions of purely rational agents, rather than on the measurement and the implications of AIs acquiring economic reasoning abilities. In any case, @parkes2015economic see economic reasoning as the ability to understand and solve complex game-theoretical environments (eg, the poker example). @mei2024turing do an extensive comparison of personality traits from the behaviour of ChatGPT with human behaviour in games that require cooperation, finding that its performance is consistent with humans, and when it deviates the AI models tend to behave in the altruistic and cooperative than the mass distribution of humans. Interestingly, ChatGPT responds differently to different formulations of the same situation. In contrast to @mei2024turing, this paper and its empirical counterpart are more generall, and discuss reasoning as a whole. Another contrast to that paper is that the current benchmark is focused on reasoning ability only, not personality. @perez2024testing illustrate the brittleness of a leading AI's reasoning on higher-order knowledge, which has markedly lower performance when trivial details in the prompts are different. Similarly, @korinek2023gen report (in his Chat 23) that results from a technical prompt in economics are reasonable but also brittle, with answers changing when prompt wording changes or even simply if the tasks are re-ordered."

    "This section builds on the intuition that in true reasoning, the result should be robust to minute perturbations, ie the model is a constant function over the domain of the input. Formally, both $\\mathbf{V}(X) = y$ and $\\mathbf{V}(X + \\epsilon) = y$ for an infinitesimal $\\epsilon$, even as $\\mathbf{V}(X') = y', y \\neq y'$, ie it should be a locally constant function. This implies the derivative with respect to the input prompt is zero. Using as an approachable example the simplest possible neural network, the logistic regression $\\mathbf{N}(x) = \\sigma(Wx + b)$, such robustness further implies that $\\frac{d\\mathbf{N}}{d x} = \\sigma(Wx + b)(1-\\sigma(Wx + b))W = 0$. Because $W$ cannot be a zero vector in a functioning network that is responsive to its inputs and $\\sigma(Wx + b)(1-\\sigma(Wx + b)) = 0$ has no solution because neither term is 0 or 1 in a sigmoid function with finite inputs, the neural network cannot be a constant function. This extremely simplified example, which holds for recursive architectures of similarly simple layers, does not bode well for the robustness of results given small perturbations in the input prompt."

On the contrary, even so much as using strings from the query itself might mislead answers due to an abundance of other sources that are based on the string and a scarcity of correctly authoritative sources that use the string. Interestingly, while the principal eigenvector of the square of the adjacency matrix offers the weights of authoritativeness especially for broad queries, the non-principal eigenvectors can offer insights into the authoritativeness of more specialised queries, and also due to their negative entries offer authorities of different perspectives (ie, weighting pros and cons)."

This implies that having question variations that refer to opposite views in the prompt should also help probe the level of knowledge (given the theoretical model that it is a function of existing knowledge graph) versus response flipping due to probabilistic association with the terms introduced to describe the pros and cons.

Economic inference depends primarily on articulating unobservable quantities, theorecised and estimated on the basis of observable measures. This is unlike other major disciplines. For example, in human and veterinary medicine, all physiological and pathological variables of clinical importance are observable, even if that is not yet technologically feasible today. In the medical sciences, theoretical models merely fill in the gaps in the absence of a technologically feasible complete measurement.

    "The strategy to use newly published academic papers as sources might broadly avoid that most of the content has been used in AI model training. However, most published papers in economics are previously published as working papers, which means they are potentially in the public domain at training time so cannot be guaranteed to be completely novel. While this is mitigated by the arguably low dissemination of secondary material about working papers (for example, one could reasonably conjecture that few recent working papers immediately become the topic of teaching notes or are referred to in more detail by other papers), a more robust practical strategy is needed, especially as the training dataset of many of the most advanced models is not publicly known."

    "**Evolve over time**: Economic reasoning evolves over time. For example, the Lucas critique (@lucas1976econometric) was influential in shifting macroeconomic modelling, while the credibility revolution described in @angrist2008mostly was similarly influential in microeconomic work. A historical perspective on the thought about causality going back to the early 18th century is found in @heckman2015causal, and Debreu [-@debreu1984economic] describes the evolution of economic theory up until that point. @lewbel2019identification offers a historical perspective on the issue of identification. For this reason, it is important to consider new works as they are incorporated in the live economic debate. This can be most directly done by drawing from academic papers in general interest economic journals, which benefit from wide impact in the profession. However, there are two main drawbacks of using academic papers to proxy for the development of economic reasoning over time. The first is the widely discussed publication bias (@andrews2019identification), but a perhaps equally important issue is that of unobserved false negatives: if many contributions that are now considered classics have been previously rejected (@mighty1994fallen), there are probably many others who will not be available for the incorporation as a benchmark task."

Drawing from the definitions more recently stated in @heckman2023econometric, those are, in order of analytical prowess, (a) the impact of a given intervention in a specific environment; (b) understanding the mechanisms by which the intervention might work; (c) forecasting the effects of the same intervention in other environments or states of the world; and (d) forecasting the effects of never-before-implemented interventions in various environments."

    "Understanding AI models' ability to reason and go beyond a pure probabilistic exercise is crucial as these models have an increasing importance in society. For example, models that suggest economic actions to people should better reflect latent, structural models that represent people's preferences or well-being rather than simply a prediction based on their observed behaviour, as argued by @kleinberg2023inversion. Models that reason better can rise up to the challenge of learning actual metrics of interest instead of real-world measurements, because the latter have added noise from human cognitive and heuristics limitations, which are then amplified by multiple types of biases in data (CITE paper on multiple biases). And with the increasing linguistic prowess of language models, their use in the economic research process (@korinek2023gen, @ludwig2024machine) is likely to increase, putting a premium on the ability to measure how well these models can reason."

    "Let me conclude with Ken Arrow's impossibility theorem (@arrow1950difficulty), or rather the story of how he achieved this incredibly influential result. Arrow first attempted to improve upon two-century-old Condorcet's paradox, and studied ways in which individual preferences could be aggregated while satisfying some intuitive conditions. It was only through repeated failures to do so that he switched the focus to attempting to prove its impossibility. While Arrow can be safely used as a prime example of economic reasoning, the point this anecdote illustrates is that breakthroughs in economic knowledge require also inspiration (in this case from the appeal of addressing Condorcet's paradox) as well as persistence and ability to change one's focus. The current work focuses on developing robust benchmarks of models' reasoning abilities in economics; further work exploring their contributions to inspiration[^ideation] and to methodological assistance (as in the example to change focus) are also warranted for a more complete assessment of models' abilities to provide cognitive support to human economists.\n",
